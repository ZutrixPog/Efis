Efis - A Simple Key-Value Store
Efis is a lightweight and efficient key-value store written in Rust. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to store, retrieve, and manage key-value pairs. Efis offers features such as automatic backups, configurable backup intervals, pub/sub messaging, and easy deployment using Docker. This README provides an overview of Efis, its features, and instructions on how to build and use it.

Features
Simple Key-Value Store: Efis allows you to store key-value pairs where the key is a string, and the value can be a string, list, set, or sorted set.

Automatic Backups: Efis automatically backs up its data to a specified directory at a configurable interval.

Configurable Backup Interval: You can set the backup interval to control how frequently Efis creates backups of its data.

Pub/Sub Messaging: Efis supports pub/sub messaging, allowing multiple clients to subscribe to specific keys and receive updates when the value of those keys changes.

Docker Support: Efis can be easily built and deployed using Docker, making it portable and convenient to run on various systems.

Commands
Efis supports the following commands:

SET: Set a key-value pair in the store.
GET: Retrieve the value for a given key.
DELETE: Delete a key-value pair.
INCREMENT: Increment the value of a numeric key by 1.
DECREMENT: Decrement the value of a numeric key by 1.
EXPIRE: Set a time-to-live (TTL) for a key. The key will be automatically deleted after the specified time.
TTL: Get the remaining time-to-live for a key.
LPUSH: Insert elements at the beginning of a list.
RPUSH: Insert elements at the end of a list.
LPOP: Remove and return the first element of a list.
RPOP: Remove and return the last element of a list.
SADD: Add elements to a set.
SMEMBERS: Get all elements of a set.
ZADD: Add elements to a sorted set with a numeric score.
ZRANGE: Get a range of elements from a sorted set.
How to Build
To build Efis, you'll need Rust installed on your system.

Clone the Efis repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/efis.git
cd efis
Build Efis using Cargo:

arduino
Copy code
cargo build --release
How to Use
To run Efis, you can use the following command:

arduino
Copy code
PORT={{port}} BACKUP_PATH={{backup_path}} BACKUP_INTERVAL={{backup_interval}} cargo run
Replace {{port}} with the port number you want Efis to listen on.
Replace {{backup_path}} with the path where Efis will store its backups.
Replace {{backup_interval}} with the backup interval in seconds.
How to Use with Docker
To run Efis using Docker, follow these steps:

Build the Docker image:

arduino
Copy code
just build-image
Tag the image for your Docker repository (optional):

bash
Copy code
docker tag efis your_docker_username/efis:latest
Push the image to your Docker repository (optional):

bash
Copy code
docker push your_docker_username/efis:latest
Run the Efis container:

arduino
Copy code
just run-image
You can also specify environment variables like PORT, BACKUP_PATH, and BACKUP_INTERVAL in the just run-image command.
How to Run Automated Backups
Efis supports automatic backups. To run automated backups, use the following command:

arduino
Copy code
just run-backup
This command will spawn a task that runs every 10 minutes and saves the data to a file.
How to Release
To build and release the Docker image to Docker Hub, use the following command:

arduino
Copy code
just release
